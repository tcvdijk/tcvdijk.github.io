                                The use of crowdsourcing provides a big opportunity for many sciences, such as geographic information science and the digital humanities. A particular application that has seen a big boom of crowd projects is the extraction of information from historical documents, since this involves many problems that continue to elude fully-automatic solutions. Numerous projects have sprung up, some with notable success (such as GB1900, Transkribus and Maps-in-the-Crowd). However, the use of volunteered information comes with major concerns about data quality. In this project we investigate novel methods for quality assessment in crowdsourcing projects: not just checking the quality at the end, but viewing the entire crowdsourcing process as a computation where we need to be careful about data quality throughout. In doing so, we open up a range of mathematical and algorithmic techniques, including Bayesian modelling, optimal task selection based on active learning,
                                and sensitivity analysis.
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>
                                Our prior experience indicates that this is not only of theoretical interest, but will indeed result in practically useful systems that outperform ad-hoc approaches. We take historical material as the main source of our experimental material, as well as considering more modern data. This serves two purposes. Firstly, this brings us closer to the other projects in the priority programme. Secondly, the methodology we have developed so far (and will continue to develop) is generally applicable: we will validate this by applying it more broadly. Fruitful applications include image recognition tasks (such as those encountered in the ENAP and COVMAP projects) and information extraction from microblogs (EVA-VGI). Through this project, we will arrive at a more refined understanding of how the power of crowdsourcing can be harnessed - by paying specific attention to the quality of data as it moves through a project, and designing algorithmically-supported
                                processes to guide it.

                            <blockquote>
                                There are many practical problems that currently cannot be solved by algorithmic means, not because our algorithms are too slow but because we have no satisfactory algorithm at all. An example for such a practical problem is the extraction of meaningful metadata from historical maps. The problem has so far defied automation, which is very unfortunate because old maps contain lots of useful information, e.g., for historians, economists, and city planners. Libraries are producing massive amounts of digitised maps by scanning their historical collections, but struggle to “understand” the contents of these collections: computer-vision algorithms are not up to the task of extracting the desired metadata and there are too many maps to do it by hand. We will attack these problems by developing smart crowdsourcing solutions. With our collaborators (such as three libraries and the Open Historical Data Map project) we will attack real problems on real data.
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Most crowdsourcing applications rely on the crowd’s most obvious power: its multitude. If we throw enough users at a problem, we may solve it by brute force. But just like brute-force algorithms are often grossly inefficient, so is the indiscriminate application of human effort. In the proposed project we will develop algorithmically-guided, adaptive user interaction where the algorithm and (sets of) users cooperate to efficiently and reliably solve a problem instance. This is achieved through proper algorithmic modeling of the underlying computational problems, followed by techniques such as active learning (efficient task selection) and sensitivity analysis (quality assurance).</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>We have developed algorithms for continuous map generalization, variable-scale label placement, and map-layout generation. Before we developed an algorithm, we always formalized the respective task as an optimization problem. Therefore, the project has not only resulted in efficient exact algorithms and heuristics for application in real-time visualization systems, but also in models of quality for a variable-scale map, with which we refer to a sequence or continuum of maps that covers an interval of scales or to a single map that displays different regions at different scales.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Our algorithms for map-layout generation enlarge user-selected focus regions in a road network map without changing the map’s size or the displayed part of the network. They reduce the scale of non-focus regions and introduce some distortion to compensate for the scale differences in the map. The distortion is much lower, however, than with existing fish-eye projections for similar tasks. Our first algorithm relies on convex quadratic programming and produces realistically-sized maps within a few seconds. A better performance, which allows for applications in real-time systems, is obtained by a second algorithm based on least-squares optimization. For the second algorithm we had to relax some of the originally hard constraints of our model. Still, it yields solutions of high cartographic quality.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Regions that are demagnified by our method obviously tend to appear cluttered in the output map. For this reason, but also to generate maps supporting continuous zooming, we have developed methods that select a subset of all road segments for a map. We have developed a probabilistic model of how humans navigate a city, which allows us to quantify the importance of every road segment. The aim is to select segments of preferably high importance while satisfying certain constraints about the output map, for example, to ensure that the network appears not too cluttered and is connected. We have studied different models of connectivity and, in some cases, have been able to prove that the selection problem is NP-hard. For several selection problems of practical relevance, however, we have found efficient exact algorithms. For the NP-hard cases we have developed approaches by integer programming, approximation algorithms, and heuristics.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>With respect to map labeling, we have considered the problem of placing text for points and linear objects in interactive maps that allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate continuously. Our general aim is to label as many objects as possible (on average over time in a dynamic setting) such that no two labels overlap. For this task, we have concentrated on the development of real-time-capable heuristics. Finally, we have developed a method for labeling linear objects in interactive 3D maps that provide a perspective view of a scene. Labels are displayed as billboards. Based on a model of forces, the method avoids overlaps between labels. At the same time, the method ensures that labels are close to their corresponding objects.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>To conclude, we have contributed many new algorithms to the rapidly growing market for web cartography, location-based services, and navigation systems. An important open question emerging from our project is how dynamic but reasonably stable (i.e., not abruptly changing) visualizations of networks can be produced</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>The FEEDBACK VERTEX SET problem on unweighted, undirected graphs is considered. Improving upon a result by Burrage et al. (Proceedings 2nd International Workshop on Parameterized and Exact Computation, pp. 192–202, 2006), we show that this problem has a kernel with O(k^3) vertices, i.e., there is a polynomial time algorithm, that given a graph G and an integer k, finds a graph G′ with O(k^3) vertices and integer k′≤k, such that G has a feedback vertex set of size at most k, if and only if G′ has a feedback vertex set of size at most k′. Moreover, the algorithm can be made constructive: if the reduced instance G′ has a feedback vertex set of size k′, then we can easily transform a minimum size feedback vertex set of G′ into a minimum size feedback vertex set of G. This kernelization algorithm can be used as the first step of an FPT algorithm for FEEDBACK VERTEX SET, but also as a preprocessing heuristic for FEEDBACK VERTEX SET.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>We also show that the related LOOP CUTSET problem has a kernel of cubic size. The kernelization algorithms are experimentally evaluated, and we report on these experiments.</blockquote>
